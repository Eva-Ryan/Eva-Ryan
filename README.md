### Hi, I'm Eva ðŸ‘‹

***

I'm a Statistics PhD student in the University of Limerick, Ireland. My PhD research is focused on the analysis of large observational cohort studies. I am particularly interested in analysing longitudinal patterns and causal effects in this type of real-world data. Outside of statistics and data science, I enjoy traveling, baking, and reading.
