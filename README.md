### Hi, I'm Eva 👋

***

I recently completed my Ph.D. in Statistics in the University of Limerick, Ireland. My PhD research focused on the analysis of large observational cohort studies. I am particularly interested in analysing longitudinal patterns and causal effects in this type of real-world data. Outside of statistics and data science, I enjoy traveling, baking, and reading.
